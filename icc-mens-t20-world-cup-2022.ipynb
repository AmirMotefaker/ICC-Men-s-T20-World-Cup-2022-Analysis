Sam Curran was named the Player of the match and also the Player of the tournament.\n\n- Although originally scheduled to be held in 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) postponed the tournament because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the re-arranged tournament held in Australia in 2022.The host nation were also the defending champions.\n\n- The host cities for matches were Adelaide, Brisbane, Geelong, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The semi-finals took place at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Pakistan beat New Zealand by seven wickets, and at the Adelaide Oval where England beat India by ten wickets.\n\n- A series of global qualifying matches took place for the right to play in the group stages of the tournament, with the two best placed teams from the groups entering the Super 12 stage, to compete alongside eight pre-qualified nations.\n\n- In April 2018, the ICC announced that the tournament would replace the scheduled 2021 ICC Champions Trophy. This was after the ICC granted full international status to Twenty20 matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards.\n\n- In October 2019, it was reported that the ICC could scrap the T20 World Cup Qualifier, which would have been used as a pathway for qualification to the T20 World Cup.Therefore, twelve teams from the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup and four teams from qualification events would advance to the T20 World Cup. On 23 January 2020, the ICC confirmed the full details of qualification for the tournament.[10] In May 2020, the ICC told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that they reserve the rights to take away hosting rights from India, after the BCCI did not secure a tax exemption from the Indian government for the tournament.\n\n- In July 2020, when the previous edition of the tournament was being reviewed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket Australia suggested that Australia could host that tournament in October 2021, and India stage this tournament a year later in 2022.[12] The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts for the tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this tournament.\n\n- Several warm-up matches were played between 10 and 19 October 2022 between all participants.The first set of matches featured the teams from the groups in the first round of the main tournament, before the teams in the Super 12 phase played their warm-up matches.These matches did not have either T20I or T20 status as teams were allowed to field all 15 members of their squad.\n\n[Official ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2022 Website](https://2022.t20worldcup.com/)\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup)\n","metadata":{}}]}
